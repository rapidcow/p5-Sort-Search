= DESCRIPTION =

This is a pure-Perl module for searching for on sorted arrays.
It deals with:

     * Bisection point with respect to a predicate:
         bisectl   bixectl   |   bixectr   bisectr

     * Trisection point with respect to an ordering:
         blsrch0   blsrch1   |   brsrch1   blsrch0
         blsrchx   blsrch2   |   brsrch2   brsrchx
